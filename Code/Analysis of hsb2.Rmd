The hsb2 data are demographics and test scores for a random sample of high 
school seniors in the nation. This will be an analysis of those scores.

```{r include=FALSE}
library(here)

```

### The relationship of SES to math performance

```{r include=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
hsb2 <- read.csv(here("Data", "hsb2.csv"))
```

Here are side-by-side boxplots of math scores by SES levels.
```{r echo=FALSE}
hsb2$ses <- factor(hsb2$ses,
                   levels = c(1:3),
                   labels = c("low", "middle", "high"),
                   ordered = TRUE)

boxplot(hsb2$math ~ hsb2$ses,
        xlab = "SES Category",
        ylab = "Math test score",
        main = "Math Test Scores by SES Category")
```
